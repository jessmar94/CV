## Jess Marais 

As someone who likes to undertake new challenges, I recently had a career change and joined a 16-week software development bootcamp at Makers Academy. I'm only at the start of my journey now, but hope, at the end of this experience, to be looking for a <b> Full Stack Junior Developer </b> role where I can consolidate and extend my skills. 

After graduating from Oxford University with a degree in Music, I worked my way up to Operations Manager at Deliveroo over two years. I then took on the role of Head of Operations at LeSalon, a tech-beauty startup, where I built up my own team and worked closely with the CTO and developers. This exposure to tech really drove my desire to learn to code - I want to be a part of the building, testing and fixing, no longer just a stakeholder. 

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Excellent Communication Skills 

During my time as Operations Manager at Deliveroo, I presented weekly to my team of 40 on KPIs, strategy and departmental and company updates. I also used this meeting as an opportunity to run Q+A sessions with my team, addressing any queries or concerns they might have had. At LeSalon, I was accountable for writing the monthly board reports on key operational KPIs and financial metrics to indicate business performance.

#### Calm and Focussed under Pressure 



#### Analytical



#### Fast Learner 

I impressed my manager, the CEO, at LeSalon with the speed at which I was able to pick up data analysis skills; in particular, using BI tools such as Chartio and SQL. I was responsible for aggregating user data to enable centralised reporting, as well as querying datasets to inform strategic decisions. Many of the reports that I built, particularly those focussed around company KPIs, were used across the business on a daily basis. 

#### Additional Skills 

- Foreign languages: Intermediate French 
- Musical instruments: Voice, Piano and French Horn

<b>Singing:</b> I have sung since I was very young and a member of presitgious choirs, such as the National Youth Choir of Great Britain. I now sing every week with the London International Gospel Choir.

<b>Travelling:</b> I enjoy visiting new places and discovering different cultures. My favourite recent trip was to Vietnam, in particular, the two-day trek I did through the tropical forests and caves of the Phong Nha National Park.
